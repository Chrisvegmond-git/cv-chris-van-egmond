# Chris van Egmond — CV

Web version of my CV with the same structure as the LaTeX/PDF version.

- **View:** Open `index.html` in a browser, or use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host it.
- **Download as PDF:** Use the “Download PDF” button — it opens the print dialog so you can save the page as PDF.
