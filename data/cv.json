  "intro": "Data scientist with a strong quantitative background who is result and people oriented. I combine this with an entrepreneurial mindset and a desire to be broadly developed. 3+ years of consultancy have allowed me to experience different sides of data projects. From creating data-driven strategic reports, to bringing a data science solution to production, designed for a team of commercial stakeholders. This allows me to deliver business relevant solutions, with a focus on creating value and communicating effectively. On the intersection of people, strategy and data — I enjoy myself the most.",
